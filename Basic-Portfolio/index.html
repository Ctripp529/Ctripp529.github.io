            <p>I am a front-end web developer with a growing passion for JavaScript and Jquery.
               I am currently taking a six-month full stack web development course, while working as an office manager at my job of seven years.
               I am a quick learner, who can manage multiple projects while staying organized, flexible and adapting to the project requirements. 
               I am resourceful when problem solving, my competitive nature drives me to fix the problem quickly and correctly.
               Iâ€™m ambitious to bring my love for code and my interpersonal skills into the project at hand, creating both an excellent site and a personal connection to the client.  </p>
